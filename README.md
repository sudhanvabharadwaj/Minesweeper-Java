# Minesweeper-Java
My attempt at building the classic Minesweeper game in Java. Used the awt and swing packages in Java. Inspired from Kenny Yip Coding on YouTube.
1. Make sure you can run Java on your computer and have jdk installed.
2. Create a new project and move both App.java and Minesweeper.java to src.
3. Run App.java
